# Minesweeper+
This is a remake of Google's <a href = "https://www.google.com/fbx?fbx=minesweeper">minesweeper</a> written in C# by using the Unity Engine. 

This project was my final exam assignment in high school. Currently, it does not yet contain all the effects that are visible in the aforementioned minesweeper, but the functionality of the game itself is done and can be played.
